          ColoRUSH is your go-to adventure planning tool for Colorado. Created
          by the FullyStacked team during an intense week-long CodeJam, this
          web app helps users plan exciting trips by selecting the outdoor
          sports and activities they want to experienceâ€”like hiking, mountain
          biking, and white-water rafting. Choose at least three activities and
          let ColoRUSH generate an optimized route so you can make the most of
          your Colorado journey.
